# How to install Oracle DB 21 Express Edition (XE), Oracle Applications Express, Oracle Rest Data Services (ORDS) on Centos8Stream
## and secure everything with a reverse proxy using Nginx / LetsEncrypt automatic HTTPS
### and not die trying. 

The following instructions are quite specific for the versions indicated below
- Oracle DB XE 21c 1.0.1
- Oracle APEX version 22.1
- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) 22.2.1

These are the current versions as of 26 Aug 2022. They might, or might not be still available at the time you read this. Although I will try to update them regularly, this is a small project I'm doing besides my regular, paying, daytime job so I don't promise I will always have the time to keep it updated with the latest versions. 

I'm using a 6â‚¬ a month CX21 Hetzner Cloud server. They are affordable, reliable and if you want to help me pay for my cloud costs, here is a referal link to subscribe: https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=uuMclGJHJMf4 

## Preliminaries:

1. Get a server or a cloud instance with 4 GB RAM, 30 (better 40) GB of SSD and at least a public IPv4 address. IPv6 optional but recommended. Operating system should be CentOS 8 Stream. 
2. Have a A/AAAA (or both) DNS record pointing at that server's IP(s).
3. Update your OS with ```dnf update```
4. Install some prerequisites with ```dnf install -y nano git java-17-openjdk yum-utils epel-release firewalld```
5. After adding the epel-release (CentOS Contrib repo) you need to install some more tools: ```dnf install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx```
6. Download the Oracle Database Preinstall package: ```wget https://yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL8/appstream/x86_64/getPackage/oracle-database-preinstall-21c-1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm```

## Install the preinstall package:

The Preinstall .RPM will do the following things for you: 

1. Create the "oracle" user and its home directory and "orainst" group
2. Install pre-requisites for Oracle DB XE
3. Configure some aspects of your system. 

You can install it by running the following command in the directory where you downloaded the package: ```dnf localinstall -y oracle-database-preinstall-21c-1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm```. Some dependencies will also be installed. 

Done! 

## Install and configure Oracle DB XE 21c 1.0.1

I also recommend to install Oracle DB from .rpm packages. It's easier and faster than other methods. 

1. Installation: 

    a. Download the installation package: ```wget https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/db-express/oracle-database-xe-21c-1.0-1.ol8.x86_64.rpm```

    b. Install it with ```dnf localinstall -y oracle-database-xe-21c-1.0-1.ol8.x86_64.rpm```. This process will take some time, on my machine it takes around 10 minutes. It will also install some dependencies. 

2. Configuration and database setup: 

    1. Run ```/etc/init.d/oracle-xe-21c configure```. This command fails the first time I run it, at least on Centos 8 Stream. If that happens to you, just re-run it, it should work fine the second time. 
    2. Enter the password of your choice when for the administrative users when prompted to do so by the script. 
    3. After the process finishes, set Oracle DB XE and TNSListener to start automatically on system reboot: ```chkconfig oracle-xe-21c on```.

    &nbsp;
    > If, for whatever reason, anything goes wrong with your database, one of the installation steps of APEX or ORDS fails and you would like to start over, you can run ```/etc/init.d/oracle-xe-21c delete``` to completely delete your database instance and start over by re-running ``/etc/init.d/oracle-xe-21c configure```.

3. Download and install APEX:
